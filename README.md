# VP6Converter

A simple tool that converts Most Wanted .vp6 files to ProStreet and up.

## Compiling from source

In order to compile VP6Converter, you'll need JDK 8 (at least) and Maven. After that navigate to the folder with the source code, where _pom.xml_ is located and run:
```
mvn clean package
```
After that, compiled jar will be located in _target_ folder. Enjoy!

## Usage

Run it in the same folder as other .vp6 files, and it will convert all of them automatically.
